Its a to-do list app which can be used to help task management easier by gamifying to-do lists.

It helps user to create a to-do list for a group of persons / one person. Each task in the list will
be assigned with points. The group members will accumulate points for tasks that they have
completed and can use the points to win a reward which would be chosen by the list creator. The
creator will create a Rewards store, in which the rewards and the number of coins needed to bag it, will
be mentioned.

The groups and list creation is done. The points system and Reward store is yet to be completed.
